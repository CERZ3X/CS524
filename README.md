# Climate Change and Correlation Analyzer

## Problem Overview

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time, impacting ecosystems, economies, and societies globally. Rising temperatures, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, sea-level rise, and natural disasters are interconnected phenomena that require integrated analysis. Existing tools lack the capability to explore these relationships interactively and comprehensively. Our project bridges this gap by providing a visualization platform for policymakers, researchers, and the public to derive actionable insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Summary of Data

We utilized publicly available datasets spanning various climate indicators:

- **Global Surface Temperature Dataset**: Historical monthly average temperatures.
- **Carbon Emissions Dataset**: Country-level CO₂-equivalent emissions data.
- **Sea Level Rise Dataset**: Mean sea-level data from the 19th century to 2020.
- **Natural Disaster Dataset**: Frequency and types of disasters (e.g., floods, droughts) from 1900–2024.

All datasets were preprocessed for consistency, handling missing values and aligning temporal and spatial granularity.

## Research Challenges

1. **Data Quality**: Missing and incomplete values required careful imputation and cleaning.
2. **Data Volume**: Large datasets necessitated efficient processing techniques.
3. **Visualization Complexity**: Designing intuitive multi-dimensional visualizations was challenging.
4. **Usability**: Ensuring interactivity and accessibility for a diverse audience.

## Results

### Visualizations
- **Temperature Analysis**: Calendar heat maps, 3D globes, and choropleth maps.
- **Carbon Emissions**: Heat maps, bar charts, and line plots highlighting emission trends.
- **Sea Level Rise**: Area and line charts showing historical trends and cumulative impacts.
- **Natural Disasters**: Stacked bar charts and correlation plots linking disasters with temperature anomalies.

### Key Insights
1. **Emissions and Temperature**: A strong positive correlation exists between CO₂ emissions and temperature anomalies.
2. **Sea Level and Warming**: Accelerating sea-level rise is strongly linked to rising global temperatures.
3. **Natural Disasters**: Increasing temperature anomalies correlate with more frequent disasters, such as floods and extreme weather.
